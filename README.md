# CCI portfolio

This is the start of my web development/resume portfolio
I will be using a combination template from my very first attempt on Wix
and my iwearthecrowns Hanari template on WordPress

Amazing what a few days away from VisualCode Studio will do
I have conveniently forgotten the steps for the git terminal :/

Save, Add, Commit, Push, Check GitHub
