# CCI portfolio

This is the start of my web development/resume portfolio
I will be using a combination template from my very first attempt on Wix
and my iwearthecrowns Hanari template on WordPress

Well, it's coded for now...
but not responsive.
I want to put it all in tables, but modern developers don't do that- YIKES

Maybe I should have two...
